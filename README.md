# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using two machine learning models: RandomForestClassifier and XGBoostClassifier. These models were selected based on their unique strengths in handling large datasets.

## Model Selection

### RandomForestClassifier
The RandomForest model is an ensemble method that uses numerous decision trees. It is known for its high training speed and low chance of overfitting, making it a reliable choice for many classification problems.

### XGBoostClassifier
The XGBoost model employs gradient boosting and regularization techniques to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. This model demonstrated superior performance in our dataset, providing higher accuracy and a lower chance of overfitting.

## Data Preprocessing

### Feature Selection
Using Seaborn, a heatmap was generated to visualize the correlation between various parameters. Based on this correlation matrix, only the most relevant features were selected for model training.

## Model Performance

### Hyperparameter Tuning
The performance of both models was evaluated using various hyperparameters to ensure optimal accuracy and generalization.

## Results
The XGBoost model outperformed the RandomForest model, offering higher accuracy and lower overfitting, and was therefore preferred for this project.

## Visualization
Correlation between features was visualized using a Seaborn heatmap, aiding in the selection of relevant parameters.
